**Electric Vehicle Data Analysis**

Welcome to my Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project! This repository showcases my work in analyzing data related to electric vehicles, exploring trends, and deriving meaningful insights. The analysis covers various aspects, including sales patterns, geographic distribution, and factors influencing electric vehicle adoption.

**Project Overview**

Data Sources: The analysis is based on publicly available datasets from sources such as Kaggle, government databases, and industry reports.

**Key Focus Areas:**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical Analysis

SQL, Power Bi

Data Visualization

**Folder Structure**

data: Folder containing the datasets used in the analysis(Electric_Vechicle_Population_data.csv).

visualizations: Visualizations and graphs generated during the analysis on power Bi (EV Analysis.pbix).

**EDA Visualizations:** Interactive charts depicting trends in electric vehicle sales, geographic distribution, and more.
